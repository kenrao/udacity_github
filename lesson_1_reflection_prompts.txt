How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

It exactly spots the place the code was changed. I don't waste time looking through the whole code for chnages. 

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    I'll know what changes were made, when and where. It's easier to go back to a particular version. 

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    The commit size is controlled and correct. 

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    So that individual project files are commited as per the project. 

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log gives the complete list of changes made to the files. git diff enables you to comapre two commit IDs and see what changes were made between teh two. 

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I can freely try out anythingn without worrying if anything goes worng, because i can always revert to a previous version. 

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I want to add my project to git.
